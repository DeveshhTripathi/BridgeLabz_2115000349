21/01/2025 Today's Summary;

Basic Arithmatic Questions: Includes different question where different mathematical operations are performed and got learning about different operators.
Conversion of Km to miles , Height Conversion are questions where we applied concepts.


23/01/2025 Today's Summary;

2D Arrays & Loops: Matrices are handled with 2D arrays and nested loops for element access.
Methods: Code is organized into methods for each matrix operation (add, subtract, multiply, transpose, inverse, determinant).
Random Numbers & Formatting: Random numbers generate test matrices, and printf formats output for readability.

28/01/2025 Today's Summary; - (2 different branches)

String and Number Operations – Includes functions for string manipulations (palindrome check, anagrams, substring occurrences) and numerical computations (factorial, Fibonacci, GCD, LCM).
Date and Time Handling – Uses ZonedDateTime and LocalDate for time zones, date arithmetic, formatting, and comparison.
Modular and Recursive Programming – Implements modular functions for tasks like prime checking, number guessing, conversions, and mathematical calculations, including recursion for factorial computation.

30/01/2025 Today's Summary;

Encapsulation & Classes: Each program defines a class (Employee, Circle, Book) with attributes and methods, demonstrating object-oriented programming.
Methods & Object Interaction: Each class has a constructor for initializing attributes and methods to process and display data (displayDetails, calculateArea, etc.).
Object Instantiation & Execution: The main method in each program creates objects and calls methods, showcasing Java's execution flow.

31/01/2025 Today's Summary:

Class and Object Usage: The code defines multiple classes (e.g., Book, Student, BankAccount, etc.), each with attributes and methods to model real-world entities.
Encapsulation and Access Modifiers: Private (private), protected (protected), and public (public) access modifiers are used to restrict direct access to class attributes.
Inheritance and Constructor Overloading: Subclasses (e.g., PostgraduateStudent, EBook, SavingsAccount, Manager) extend base classes to inherit properties, and constructor overloading is used to initialize objects with default and parameterized values.

03/02/2025 Today's Summary:

This and Super Usage: Each program defines classes (e.g. Bank Account , Book, Employee etc) solving real world problems using real world entities.
Display Details : Displaying details of the user using instanceof for checking if it's the instance of the class.

06/02/2025 Today's Summary
Inheritance in java : Got learnings about inheritance, how can we extend and implement in classes from parents class to child class and from interface to a class respectively. Also resolved different real world problems using different ways such as : 
Single Level Inheritance
 Multilevel Inheritance
 Hierarchical Inheritance
Some Real World Problems are as follows : (AnimalInheritance1 EmployeeInheritance2 TransportInheritance3 BookInheritance4 SmartDevicesInheritance5 OrderManagementInheritance6 EducationalInheritance7 BankInheritance8 SchoolSystemInheritance9 RestaurantInheritance10 VehicleManagementInheritance11)
