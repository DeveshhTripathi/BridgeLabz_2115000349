30/01/2025 Today's Summary;

Encapsulation & Classes: Each program defines a class (Employee, Circle, Book) with attributes and methods, demonstrating object-oriented programming.
Methods & Object Interaction: Each class has a constructor for initializing attributes and methods to process and display data (displayDetails, calculateArea, etc.).
Object Instantiation & Execution: The main method in each program creates objects and calls methods, showcasing Java's execution flow.

31/01/2025 Today's Summary:

Class and Object Usage: The code defines multiple classes (e.g., Book, Student, BankAccount, etc.), each with attributes and methods to model real-world entities.
Encapsulation and Access Modifiers: Private (private), protected (protected), and public (public) access modifiers are used to restrict direct access to class attributes.
Inheritance and Constructor Overloading: Subclasses (e.g., PostgraduateStudent, EBook, SavingsAccount, Manager) extend base classes to inherit properties, and constructor overloading is used to initialize objects with default and parameterized values.

03/02/2025 Today's Summary:

This and Super Usage: Each program defines classes (e.g. Bank Account , Book, Employee etc) solving real world problems using real world entities.
Display Details : Displaying details of the user using instanceof for checking if it's the instance of the class.
